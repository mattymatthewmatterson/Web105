            <h2>Uncommon Ska Influences</h2>
            <p>One popular style that roots from Ska is known as Dub or <code>Dub Step</code>. Dub is a slower form of Rock Steady and it has inspired many styles of music including Jungle.</p>
            <p>Early Jungle beats and record scratching hits featured Dub music. Many <code>"Junglists"</code> today believe that their music wouldn't have existed if it hadn't been for Dub.</p>

                <h2>Reggae</h2>
                <p>Much more popular than Ska, Reggae has deep political roots. It is still very popular today and even modern groups have Reggae influences</p>
                 <h2>Rock Steady</h2>
                <p>Originating close to the same time as Reggae, Rock Steady is a type of Ska with more <code>Jazz</code> as well as <code>Rythem and Blues</code> Many people prefer to dance to Rock Steady than Reggae.</p>
                <h3>Dub Music</h3>
                <p>Sometimes referred to <code>Dub</code>, Dub descended from Ska through Reggae. Similar to Reggae with it's slower sounds, Dub focuses more on the drums as well as the bass of the music.</p>
