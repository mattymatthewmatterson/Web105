                <p>Some puppies are picky and they won't eat anything. That's why it's important to learn what they enjoy eating and try to mimic their taste buds. <a href="https://wholefully.com/handmade-holiday-healthy-homemade-dog-treats/" target=_blank><code>Homemade Dog Treats</code></a> are one of the best ways to pamper your puppy. They get to enjoy their treats, which makes training them a much easier process.</p>
